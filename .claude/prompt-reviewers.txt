 Logic for finding reviewer candidates should be as follows:
  - We are lookin for two pairs of people: the primary - with the most author context in the changed lines, and the secondary - who is the most active reviewer other than the primary

To find the primary reviewer, we need to come up with a list of candidates who know this code the best, and track how we decided to make them a candidate. This is the fallback/priority order of who should be considered a great primary:
  * Examining the same Github blame history for the previously existing files, consider the top 5 PR's in the size of their overlap with the lines editing this file. The authors of these most recent PR's that overlap are the next priority for the primary reviewer, but only if the author_association shows they still have write access to the repository.
  * The next best reviewer is the most recent author for a merged PR that impacted a file in this directory.
  * The next best reviewer is the most recent author for a merged PR in this project.

You'll need to look at the author_association for each author candidate to understand if they have write access and are thus a valid reviewer.

To find the secondary reviewer,  we need to come up with a list of candidates who know actively review code, and track how we decided to make them a candidate. This is the fallback/priority order of who should be considered a great secondary:

  * Examining the same Github blame history for the previously existing files, consider the top 5 PR's in the size of their overlap with the lines editing this file. The reviewer of these most recent PR's that overlap are the highest priority for the primary reviewer.
  * The next best reviewer is the most recent reviewer for a merged PR that impacted a file in this directory.
  * The next best reviewer is the most recent reviewer for a merged PR in this project.

Every PR should have at least two reviewers. The author of the current PR cannot be a reviewer. The primary and secondary must be different people.

When proposing a reviewer for a PR, be sure to log which of these selection mechanisms the reviewer was selected by.
